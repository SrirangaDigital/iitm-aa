In the interim, he worked with Rambhal Industries and pursued an MBA from IIM Bangalore, both of which helped to prepare him for his entrepreneurial venture. Creating a world-class manufacturing company from scratch is a commendable achievement given the capital requirements of the sector (automobile components), as well as the legal and bureaucratic challenges involved in launching such an enterprise in India.</p><p>Started in 1986 from a small workshop, Sansera Engineering has become a Rs 700 crore company today, with 9 plants located all across the country and more than 3,000 employees. Meeting the stringent requirements of demanding clients, who include Maruti Suzuki, General Motors, Yamaha, Honda Motors, and Ducati, is no easy task, but Shri Vasan has proved time and again to be up to the challenge. When the firm just started out, it received an order to supply 5,000 pieces per month against a capacity to produce only 1,000 pieces; this was accomplished by a quick and efficient ramp-up, an early indicator of similar achievements in future. Shri Vasan has led from the front and from the floor, often machining in the workshop himself to ensure that production needs are met. During the last 6 years, turnover has grown at a 20% compounded rate every year, from Rs. 210 crores in 2008-09 to Rs.700 crores in 2013-14.</p><p>All of Sansera's forgings are produced in-house in one of the best facilities for high-precision small forgings in the country. Another commendable feature of Sansera is the in-house design and production of most of the 450+ machines installed and in operation in the various units. Sansera has won many awards from its customers both in India and abroad, including a Best Practices Recognition from General Motors and a Quality Award from Yamaha Motors in 2012. Acknowledging the dedication and the commitment of the founder, Citi Ventures has recently invested Rs 300 crores into the firm.</p><p>The Sansera Foundation has undertaken many socially-responsible initiatives around the residential area of its workforce, including provision of scholarships to rural students, sponsorship of a Government School building, employment for the physically-challenged and volunteer work in waste segregation and recycling.</p><p>The struggle to achieve excellence, and to gain acceptance of the most demanding automobile customers in the world is a Himalayan task. In recognition of Shri Sekhar Vasan's ability to build and sustain such a large and successful manufacturing organization in India, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer upon him this award.</p></div></div></div>
