He is currently Professor of Radiology and Associate Director at the EPR Center for the Study of Viable Systems in the Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College. Prior to this, he was Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Ohio State University, Columbus. He also served as Director of the Center for Biomedical EPR Spectroscopy and Imaging at Ohio State University from 2002-13.</p><p>Post-doctorate, Dr. Kuppusamy was Fogarty Fellow (1986-87) at the National Institute on Aging, NIH, Baltimore, MD, and also served as Research Fellow (1987-90) at John Hopkins University, School of medicine, Baltimore, MD. During this period, he worked with two renowned biophysicists - Dr. J.M. Rifkind and Dr. J.L. Zweier - thereby beginning the journey from chemistry to physics to biology. Dr. Kuppusamy was a pioneer in connecting the technologies of imaging and EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy, giving rise to the EPR Imaging field, which still has only a few expert practitioners worldwide. His positions of responsibility in fields as diverse as heart and lung care, cardiovascular medicine, and spectroscopy reflect the interdisciplinary nature of his work.</p><p>Dr. Kuppusamy considers it his mission to create new knowledge, and to disseminate it to a large number of intelligent young men and women. The large number of students he has mentored bear testimony to this. His 300+ plus publications over 30 years in high-impact factor journals, and the 7 patents are indicative of the quality of his technical vitality. Dr. Kuppusamy has, more than anything else, created Centers of Excellence to produce quality manpower and research. Noteworthy among his many awards are: Doctor of Medicine, honoris causa, conferred by the University of Pecs, Hungary; Silver Medal for Biology/Medicine awarded by the International EPR Society; and the Lumley Award for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Research, awarded by the Ohio State University College of Engineering in 2011. To highlight another facet of Dr. Kuppusamy's contributions, his development and production of multilingual (Tamil/English/French/Malay) multimedia software for learning Tamil language and literature has enabled the Tamil diaspora to stay connected to their roots. His contribution to the digital Tamil revolution has been recognized by a Doctor of Letters award conferred in June 2012 by the International Tamil University.</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Periannan Kuppusamy's pioneering contributions to the field of EPR Imaging and his commitment to mentoring of young minds, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
