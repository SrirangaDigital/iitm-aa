Shri Rajendra has been the driving force behind A.O. Smith's implementation of a large-scale manufacturing facility for water heaters in Harohalli, Bengaluru. The investment of $ 25-30 million was greenfield - adding capacity by purchasing land and building a factory, rather than simply purchasing existing assets. The factory, established in 2010, manufactures residential water heaters specially designed for robust use in the Indian subcontinent, and is now adding capability to manufacture water purification products. The Company is growing its business while generating employment in India, and providing a technologically advanced product to the Indian consumer. A.O. Smith continues to invest its proceeds from this operation back into the Indian business, benefiting the community greatly. The Company exclusively uses national talent in India, and consequently there are no expatriates in Harohalli. Current employment is about 400, of which approximately 50 are professionals.</p><p>Shri Rajendra's professional accomplishments are reflected in the various corporate awards he has been a recipient of, such as the Corporate Marketing Award in three different years, and the highly-regarded Individual Outstanding Contributor Award from the Board of Directors of Corning.
