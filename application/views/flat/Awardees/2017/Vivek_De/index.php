He obtained his Ph. D from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY in 1992. He is currently an Intel Fellow and Director of Circuit Technology Research in Intel Corporation. He is responsible for providing strategic technical directions for long term research in future circuit technologies and leading energy efficiency research across the hardware stack.</p><p>Dr. De’s career journey began as a Graduate Technical Intern at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center, NY in 1990. Prior to joining Intel, he was engaged in semiconductor devices and circuits research at RPI and at Georgia Institute of Technology, and was a visiting researcher at Texas Instruments. Dr. De has made pioneering contributions to circuit design at Intel over the past 20 years by leading research teams in the development of advanced circuits and design techniques for low-power and high-performance processors. Since 2013, he has served as Principal Investigator for a USD 13 million DARPA research program on Circuits for Resilient Systems (CREST). The techniques developed by Dr. De have been implemented on all Intel Core and Atom processors. He led a team that demonstrated the world’s first near-threshold voltage ultra-low-power Pentium processor powered fully by a solar cell. His work on fully integrated voltage regulators implemented in Intel Core based server and client processors received an “Intel Achievement Award (IAA)”, the highest corporate technical award in Intel.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Dr. De was appointed as an “Intel Fellow” in 2006, which represents the highest level of technical achievement within the company. He is one of only four IIT Madras alumni to achieve this distinction. Dr. De has 209 patents granted and 26 more patents filed (pending). He has published 250 technical papers in refereed international conferences &amp; journals, and authored 7 book chapters. He has served as Associate Editor and Guest Editor for premier IEEE Journals. He is a Fellow of the IEEE.</p><p>For his exemplary accomplishments in Circuit Technology Research, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to bestow this award upon Dr. Vivek De.</p></div></div></div>
