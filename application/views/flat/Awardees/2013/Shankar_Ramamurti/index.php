He is also the first Indian after Nobel-Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar to be awarded the Harvard Junior Fellowship.  In 2009, Dr. Ramamurti was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize from the American Physical Society for “Innovative applications of field theoretic techniques to quantum condensed matter systems”.</p><p>Dr. Ramamurti is dedicated to teaching and has published more than hundred journal publications and three books. He has designed and taught a one semester course in Physics aimed at freshmen and sophomores for more than a decade. The book he wrote based on this course, “Basic Training in Mathematics”,now serves as the textbook on the subject in many institutions worldwide.  His courses in Physics have been video-taped and made available online as part of Yale’s Open Courses funded by the Hewlett Foundation. These lectures are used worldwide and serve as core material for some courses.</p><p>Dr. Ramamurti was elected as Fellow of the American Physical Society since 2001. His contributions in Statistical Physics, Particle Theory and, more recently the fractional quantum Hall-effect are outstanding.</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Shankar Ramamurti’s academic excellence and research contributions in the field of particle and condensed-matter physics, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award. </p></div></div></div>
