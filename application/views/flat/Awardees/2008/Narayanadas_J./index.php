Narayana Das is currently the Director of Naval Materials Research Laboratory, Ambarnath (DRDO). He received his B.Tech (1971), M.S. (1987) and Ph.D (1993) degrees in Chemical Engineering from IIT Madras.</p><p>During his nearly 36 years of R&amp;D career in DRDO, in various capacities, Dr. Narayana Das has made outstanding contributions in Materials Science and Technology, adding great value to strategic self-reliance and industrial progress. At the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory, in the early 1980s, he initiated R &amp; D in the specialized area of passive acoustic materials and studied acoustic wave propagation through fiber composites. He has been instrumental in development of patented special rubber compounds for application in SONAR sensor technologies. In recognition of his significant contributions, DRDO conferred on him the “Scientist of the Year” Award in 1998. His work in the field of Magneto-rheological fluids and Magneto-resistive fluids have earned two US patents.</p><p>As Director, NMRL, he has been playing the lead role in conceptualization, development and productionisation of materials of crucial importance to Naval technology. Example of the many self-reliance initiatives he has led are Welding technology for Ship Building Steels and Industrialisation of “Fuel Cell” technology in the Country. NMRL is poised to launch 33 KW Fuel Cell based Power Plant in 2008. DRDO has promoted him to the select grade of “Outstanding Scientist” in 2007. Under his stewardship, the NMRL has won the Titanium Trophy of DRDO in 2005.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of Materials Science &amp; Technology and his search for self-reliance in strategic defence technologies, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
