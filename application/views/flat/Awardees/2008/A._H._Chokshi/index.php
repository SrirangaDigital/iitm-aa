Prior to joining IISc in 1994, he was on the faculty of University of California, San Diego for five years. He has held visiting faculty positions in more than six Universities in USA, Europe and Japan. He received his B.Tech degree in Metallurgy from IIT Madras in 1980 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southern California, USA.</p><p>Dr. Chokshi is one of the pioneers of the new branch of materials science, viz., mechanical behaviour of nanomaterials. He has made significant contributions in the area of superplasticity and has contributed significantly to the understanding of deformation mechanisms that bring about this phenomenon. He has made in-depth studies on the effect of temperature, grain size and microstructure on the superplastic deformation, creep, and diffusion in ceramics, ceramic composites and magnesium alloys.</p><p>Dr. Chokshi has published over 130 papers in highly cited international journals. He is ranked among the top 100 most cited materials scientists in the world.</p><p>Dr. Chokshi has received many honours and awards. He is a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Academy of Engineering, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India. He is the recipient of J D Birla Award (2006) and Metallurgist of the Year Award (2001) from the Indian Institute of Metals, S. S. BhatnagarAward (2003), MRSI Medal (2000) and Swarnajayanthi Presidential Young Scientist Award (1998).</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of materials engineering, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
