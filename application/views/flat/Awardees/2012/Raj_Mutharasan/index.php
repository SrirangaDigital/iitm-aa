Fletcher Professor, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Drexel University, USA (1969/BT/CH).</p><p>Dr. Raj Mutharasan obtained his B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1969 with ‘First Rank’. Subsequently, he earned his Ph.D. degree from Drexel University in Chemical Engineering in 1973. He currently serves as Frank A. Fletcher Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Drexel University.</p><p>Prof. Mutharasan has had a distinguished and remarkable career in both teaching and research. He is professionally active, chairing many research symposia as well as organizing major research conferences held by AIChE, Engineering Foundation, AIME and others. He has served in the academic leadership ranks such as the Interim Dean of College of Engineering (1997-2001) at Drexel University. Three major scientific and engineering societies (AIChE, AIMBE and AAAS) have recognized his contribution to his chosen field by electing him as a Fellow. Another remarkable achievement of Prof. Mutharasan is sustained transfer of technology from his laboratory to the industrial and commercial world. His early work on process control led to the development of the “Gautam-Mutharasan” algorithm, which, in modified form, is incorporated into commercial process control systems. His second major commercialization is related to his recent work on biosensors, which has received 4 patents already with eight more pending.</p><p>During his career, Prof. Mutharasan has served as technical consultant to industry, as well as on the Science Advisory Board of several corporations; some of his notable appointments are those on the Board of Apogee, Inc. (founded by one of his PhD students), and on Leversense LLC (which is based on Prof. Mutharasan’s biosensor invention)</p><p>As evidenced by the above summary of achievements, Professor Mutharasan’s career over the past 40 plus years has had a profound impact on society in general, in addition to leaving an imprint on academia, scientific research and industrial linkage. The extent of Prof. Mutharasan’s social involvement is evidenced by his civic activities, which include serving as President of various cultural societies in the U.S. He has also served as Advisor to many graduate students coming from India.</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Raj Mutharasan’s contributions to research, technology commercialization, and societal outreach, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
