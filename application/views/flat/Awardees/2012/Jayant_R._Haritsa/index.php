Haritsa, Senior Professor, Department of Computer Science &amp; Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (1985/BT/EE).</p><p>Prof. Haritsa obtained his B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1985. He subsequently graduated from University of Wisconsin with an M.S. (1987) and Ph.D. (1991) in Computer Science. He is a Senior Professor at the Supercomputer Education &amp; Research Centre and Department of Computer Science &amp; Automation at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.</p><p>Over the past two decades, Prof. Haritsa has made high-impact contributions to the theory, algorithms, data structures and architectural design of database engines, which form the core of enterprise information systems. His work has spanned transaction-processing and decision-support environments, the two main streams of database research. He has been the problem-definer in a majority of his work, breaking new ground in a variety of topics, including real-time databases, data-mining, XML databases, multi-lingual databases, biological databases and query optimization.</p><p>A particularly noteworthy industrial contribution of Prof. Haritsa is the Picasso software that he has designed and constructed over the past seven years. Picasso is a visualization tool for the systematic investigation, understanding and redesign of database query optimizers. IISc has obtained copyright on the software from the Government of India, and several leading database vendors, as well as elite academic research groups worldwide, have incorporated Picasso in their workbench. The tool has been welcomed as a potent pedagogical resource for database instruction, and recently received the Best Demonstration award at VLDB 2010, a top-ranked international database conference.</p><p>Prof. Haritsa is also the recipient of the ACM Distinguished Scientist honor, and the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize. He has been elected a Fellow of Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS), National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI), and Indian National Academy of Engineering (INAE), and has been granted faculty awards from blue-chip multinationals in recognition of his stellar research accomplishments.</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Jayant Haritsaâ€™s research contributions to design and optimization of database engines, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
