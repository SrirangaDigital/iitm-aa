Ever since, he has pushed the boundaries of the field with his work in probabilistic methods, algorithms and networks. With its roots in fundamental research, his work has increasingly shifted to the use of computing in the service of society. In the years following his Ph.D., he has held various positions, including with the Institute of Advanced Study (Princeton, USA), National University of Singapore (Singapore) and, more recently, the University of Maryland (Maryland, USA). He also served a brief stint as a Member of Technical Staff in the Mathematics of Networks and Systems Research Department of Bell Laboratories between 1998 and 2001, filing several patents related to innovation in network algorithms.</p><p>Dr. Srinivasan has held various positions of responsibility. He has held visiting positions at various institutions including IIT Madras, MIT and Cornell (USA), Max-Planck Institute (Germany), University of Melbourne (Australia), University of Venice (Italy), Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel) and Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (Netherlands). His commitment to guidance of research scholars is evident in the multiple awards and accolades received by his doctoral students at various international forums.</p><p>As a researcher, Dr. Srinivasan is an academician par excellence. With over 175 papers in various forms including refereed journals and conferences, book chapters and invited articles, his mastery in the ever-evolving field of Computer Science is unquestionable. He has been named an ACM Fellow, AAAS Fellow, and IEEE Fellow in recognition of his contribution to research in the field. He is currently the Editor-in-Chief of the 'ACM Transactions of Algorithms' (TALG), Managing Editor of 'Theory of Computing', and an Associate Editor of 'Networks'. His algorithm for hypergraph colouring has been hailed as having "...a number of subtle and beautiful steps that took more than thirty-five years to find."</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Aravind Srinivasan's sustained and path-breaking research in the field of Computer Science, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
