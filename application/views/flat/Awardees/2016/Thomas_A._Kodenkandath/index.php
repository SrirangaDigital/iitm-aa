His career highlight is a paper published in J. American Chemical Society (JACS) in 2009 on the discovery of an unprecedented class of materials, with a new structure, which is considered as pioneering in the field of rational design and synthesis of materials with predicable composition, structure and properties. The proudest moment of his industrial R&amp;D career was when TIME magazine selected the flexible solar cells that he helped develop at Ascent Solar as one of the best inventions of 2011.</p><p>It is, however, his excellence in cartooning under the name "Thommy" that sets Dr. Kodenkandath apart.
