Following this, he completed his Ph.D. from the same University in 1989. After the completion of his doctoral thesis, he has gone on to work in the field of Design Automation for high-performance integrated circuits, and today is considered a pioneer in the field of circuit analysis and optimization. His techniques have significantly impacted three generations of processors, gaming and ASIC chips. Currently working as the Director of the Smarter Energy Research Institute (SERI), and as an IBM Fellow in Smarter Energy and Environmental Science, he is one of only 95 active IBM Fellows (out of 400,000 employees) and one of only 267 employees in the history of the company to be awarded the Fellowship.</p><p>Perhaps best known for perfecting the technique of statistical timing analysis, Dr. Visweswariah invented a method to reduce pessimism in chip performance prediction, influencing the consumer experience of thousands of end-users of IBM chips. For this, he was recognized as the 'Innovator of the Year' by EDN magazine (2006). Academically, he has held visiting and voluntary posts at various institutions including Eindhoven University of Technology (Netherlands), University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Carnegie Mellon University (USA). His continued innovation and creativity is evident in the 94 patents to his name. Furthermore, he has authored over 100 publications in refereed journals, and as book chapters and invited articles. Apart from the numerous 'Best Paper' awards and accolades, Dr. Visweswariah is also an IEEE Fellow, and has chaired various panels and sessions on a range of subjects in the field.</p><p>Dr. Visweswariah is actively involved in social work. Selected for the IBM Executive Service Corps in 2010, he volunteered to provide consulting to the City of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on the needs of urban sustainability. This association with community service reverberates throughout his work in education, healthcare, accessibility for the disabled, environmental efforts and child nutrition.</p><p>In recognition of Dr. Visweswariah's dedication to academia, revolutionary work in industry and commitment to social causes, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer on him this award.</p></div></div></div>
