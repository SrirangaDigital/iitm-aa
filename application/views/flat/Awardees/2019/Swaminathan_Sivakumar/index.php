				<span>Intel Senior Fellow, Technology and Manufacturing Group Director of Lithography, Portland Technology Development Intel Corporation, USA</span><br /><span>1987/B.Tech/EE</span>
			</p>
			<p>Shri Swaminathan Sivakumar graduated from IIT Madras in 1987 with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. He obtained his Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 1989. Shri Sivakumar joined Intel in 1990 as a lithography process engineer and has dedicated his career to the lithography area, working on  photo-resists, patterning equipment, and process development. His contributions to lithography development, characterization and transfer to high-volume manufacturing have spanned every sub-micron process technology generation of Intel since 1990. He has authored or co-authored more than two dozen published papers on semiconductor processing and has been issued more than 45 patents in process architecture, lithography and patterning, with several more pending. As a heavily sought-after speaker at conferences, Shri Sivakumar has presented extensively at international technical gatherings on topics ranging from lithography to fab process technology.</p>
			<p>He has served as Director of Lithography at Intel since 2002, leading the definition, development and deployment of Intel's next-generation lithography processes. He is also responsible for developing resolution-enhancement techniques and optical proximity-correction technologies in support of Intel's leading-edge patterning solutions. He co-invented industry-leading interconnect patterning techniques for aluminum metallization on the 180nm process, as well as the dual-damascene copper metallization on the 130nm and newer processes.</p>
			<p>An Intel Fellow since 2002, he was named an Intel Senior Fellow in 2014. His work has been honoured three times with the Intel Achievement Awards, the company's highest technical award. His technological achievements have also been recognized outside Intel, most recently in 2016 when the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign awarded him their Distinguished Alumnus Award. In 2012, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers honoured him with the IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award for his outstanding contributions to the field of lithography.</p>
			<p>For his fundamental contributions to the art and science of lithography, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer this award upon Shri Swaminathan Sivakumar.</p>
