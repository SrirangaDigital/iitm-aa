			<p>Dr. G. Ayyappan is a liquid propulsion specialist and a systems engineer in the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). He completed his B.Sc. (Engg.) from College of Engineering, Kerala University in  1982, M.Tech  from IIT Madras in 1987 and his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Kerala University in 2017. </p>
			<p>Since joining ISRO in 1982, he has spearheaded some of the most important projects crucial for the country's space research. He led the 'Team ISRO' as Vehicle Director for GSLV MK-III experimental flight-LVM3-X/CARE Mission to a successful flight on December 18, 2014. He was subsequently designated as the Project Director of GSLV MK-III, the most challenging new generation launch vehicle of ISRO for 4T class GSO satellites. He led the project techno-managerially during the crucial phase of development and qualification of vehicle systems. He was Mission Director in the first flight of the rocket on 5th June 2017, which was a success.  Notably, GSLV MK-III is also the rocket which is intended to carry out India's first manned mission. Currently, he is the Programme Director, Space Transportation System at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram.
