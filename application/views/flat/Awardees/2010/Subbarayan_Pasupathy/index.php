After graduating with first rank in the first batch of M.Tech students of IIT Madras in 1966, Prof. Pasupathy obtained M.Phil and Ph.D degrees in Communication from Yale University, in 1970 and 1972, respectively. Prof. Pasupathy is at present a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada.</p><p>An abiding interest in teaching, developed at IIT Madras while he was a Research Student and Part-time Lecturer (1965-67), led Prof. Pasupathy to choose an academic career spanning more than 35 years in undergraduate and graduate teaching and research at the University of Toronto (1972-2007). Starting with his first publication in 1966, based on his M.Tech thesis at IIT Madras, Prof. Pasupathy also developed a great passion for research, and one his great accomplishments is the large number of graduate students and postdoctoral students he has trained over the course of 35 years.</p><p>Prof. Pasupathy is an international authority on the application of statistical communication theory and techniques to the design of digital communication systems. He was the first Canadian Professor in the area of communications to be listed in the prestigious “highly cited researchers” list of ISI Web of Knowledge (ISIHighlyCited.com), attesting to the widespread influence his research has had on both theory and practice. He has contributed high-quality, scholarly work to leading journals and conferences — in fact, more than 275 articles and contributions to 3 books. His contributions have been cited in more than 100 patent applications. Prof. Pasupathy’s specific influential-contributions lie in the area of bandwidth-efficient digital communication systems and application of statistical communication theory to a wide spectrum of areas such as array processing, computer algorithms for signal processing, DNA sequencing, advanced transceiver structures, mobile cellular networks, and coding algorithms and architectures.</p><p>He is a Fellow of IEEE Engineering Institute of Canada, and Canadian Academy of Engineering, and received the 2003 Award in Telecommunication from the Canadian Institute of Information Theory. For over fourteen years, he wrote the humour column “Light Traffic”, a feature of the IEEE Communications Magazine. Prof. Pasupathy is a student, by choice, of Tamil literature, and poetry. His poems and articles have appeared in several reputed magazines such as “Kalaimagal”, “Amudhasurabhi” and “Gopura Darsanam, and in Internet magazines such as “Thinnai” and “Hub”. He is a moderator and an active participant in many Yahoo and Google groups promoting Tamil literature.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of digital communications, Science and Engineering, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer this award on him.</p></div></div></div>
