In 1985, he earned a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from CarnegieMellon University (Pittsburgh, PA).</p><p>For the last 25 years, Dr. Chordia has pioneered R &amp; D in, and commercial applications of, supercritical fluid technology, a green materials-processing technology. In 1982, Dr. Chordia co-founded his first company, Suprex Corp. and then served as Vice President of Engineering and R &amp; D. The vision of Suprex was to commercialize the nascent technology of supercritical fluids, and it focused on small scale analytical supercritical fluid systems. With eight years of process and equipment R &amp; D experience, coupled with greater maturity in the market for supercritical fluid technology, Dr. Chordia left Suprex in 1990 to form Thar Technologies. Dr. Chordia’s move enabled him to exploit a growing market for larger-scale supercritical fluid systems and process development services.</p><p>Through his technological and commercial leadership, Dr. Chordia has taken Thar from one-employee to a global leader in its field with four technology groups in Pittsburgh and two international subsidiaries (including one in Chennai). Today, Thar offers a complete line of laboratory-through-process scale systems, research and development services, toll processing and technology licensing. Examples of Thar’s involvement in process and equipment development include: drug design and purification, spice and nutraceutical extraction, solvent removal, environmental recovery, electronics cooling and cleaning, smart components, self-sealing systems, high efficiency processing and automated handling. Dr. Chordia is the holder of 12 patents and has over 20 pending patents.</p><p>Recognizing his accomplishments, the United States Small Business Administration Office named Dr. Chordia the 2002 U.S Small Business Exporter of the year, an award he won in a competition against companies with up to 500 employees. In the same year, Thar, with Dr. Chordia as the primary investigator, also won a prestigious National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Technology Program Award to develop novel electronics cooling technology.</p><p>Dr. Chordia is a co-founder of the US-India forum, which promotes business and political cooperation between the USA and India, and an Adjunct Research Scientist at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie-Mellon University. He has been featured in several international publications, including Fortune. He is deeply involved in numerous civic and educational organizations in Pittsburgh.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the development of large-scale supercritical fluid technology, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer this award on him.</p></div></div></div>
