Ramamurthy is an internationally acclaimed pioneer and leader in organic photochemistry. His contributions have provided new theoretical and experimental paradigms for the fields of supramolecular photochemistry, modern mechanistic organic photochemistry and organic photochemical reactions in constrained media. This is evidenced by his very large number of research publications (about 310 as of now), most of them in the highest-rated journals, and 34 students who have received their Ph.D degrees under his direction. His significant achievements in, and substantial contributions to, chemistry include: pioneering developments in the fields of controlling chemistry in crystals, mechanistic organic photochemistry, photochemistry of thio compounds, general theory of organic photochemistry, asymmetric photoreactions, zeolite photochemistry, direct spectroscopic detection and characterization of reactive intermediates within confined environments, organic photochemistry in micelles, and control of reactivity through supramolecular effects.</p><p>Prof. Ramamurthy has made an immense impact on the education of recent generations of physical organic chemists and photochemists (nationally and internationally). His book ‘Photochemistry in Constrained Media’ is a standard text in the field for the last sixteen years. He is one of the co-authors of the text book ‘Modern Molecular Photochemistry of Organic Molecules’, a recently (2009) revised version of Turro’s “Modern Molecular Photochemistry” considered as the bible in thefield of photochemistry since its publication in 1978. The “Molecular and Supramolecular Photochemistry” series, consisting of 14 volumes co-edited by Prof. Ramamurthy, are considered essential reference sources in photochemistry.</p><p>Prof. Ramamurthy is a Senior Editor for Langmuir, the American Chemical Society journal devoted to Chemistry at Interfaces. In addition, he also serves on the editorial board of some of the leading journals in chemistry. He has received the Grammatikakis?Neumann Prize of the European PhotochemicalSociety, the LAS Faculty Research Award and Cooper Fellowship from the University of Miami. He was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1986. He was on the faculty at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore from 1978-87, and was ICOS Visiting Professor and Fulbright fellow at the same Institution during 2002-2003.</p><p>In recognition of his sustained excellence in, and outstanding contributions to, the field of Organic Photochemistry, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer this award on him.</p></div></div></div>
