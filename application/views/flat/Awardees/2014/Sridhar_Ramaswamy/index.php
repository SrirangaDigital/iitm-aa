He began his career at Bell Communications Research and later became a Scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, where his innovations included the AQUA database that pioneered the new direction of giving very fast approximate answers to queries. Prior to joining Google, he held several roles at E.piphany, including Director of Engineering for E.piphany's Analytic Platform</p><p>Dr. Ramaswamy joined Google in 2003 as a software engineer in the ads infrastructure team.
