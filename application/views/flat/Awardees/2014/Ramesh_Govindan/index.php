He was one of the earliest researchers to study the internet packet routing system, and was also among the first researchers to map the Internet. His "Mercator" network-mapper produced extensive views of the internet backbone at the time. He also devised novel methods to improve the accuracy of these maps.</p><p>Prof. Govindan's most recent contributions have been in the area of wireless networked sensing. Two of his early papers in the field of "Directed Diffusion and Geographic Hash-Tables" proved seminal and illustrated both the challenges posed by wireless networks of sensors, and the opportunities for novel designs. Subsequently, his Group made fundamental contributions to geographic routing in wireless and sensor networks, exploring a novel network architecture called "Tenet" for wireless sensing that factors in network functionality in a manner that promotes code reuse and simplifies application development.</p><p>Prof. Govindan is a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery, a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the winner of many Best Paper awards. Until recently, he served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.</p><p>In recognition of Prof. Ramesh Govindan's academic excellence and research contributions in the field of Computer Networking and Network Sensing, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer him this award.</p></div></div></div>
