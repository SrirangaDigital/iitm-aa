			</p>
			<p>Dr. B. Jayant Baliga graduated with a B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1969 as recipient of the Philips India Medal and the Special Merit Medal (as valedictorian). He completed his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the field from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York in 1971 and 1974, respectively. He is an internationally renowned expert in the field of power semiconductor devices. Currently he is a Distinguished University Professor at North Carolina (NC) State University, where he is also the Director of the Power Semiconductor Research Center. As an academic, Dr. Baliga has authored/ edited 19 books and has more than 550 publications as well as 120 U.S. patents to his credit.</p>
			<p>Prior to his time with NC State University, Dr. Baliga spent fifteen years at the General Electric (GE) Research and Development Center, leading their power device effort. At GE, he was bestowed the highest scientific rank of Coolidge Fellow. During his time at GE, Dr. Baliga invented, developed and commercialized the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) which is used extensively across multiple industries including consumer, transportation and medical, enabling reduction of gasoline and electrical energy use. Dr. Baliga’s contribution not only lowers costs but also minimizes global carbon dioxide emissions. For this work, Dr. Baliga was conferred with Russia’s top technology award, the Global Energy Prize (considered energy equivalent of the Nobel Prize) in 2015. Scientific American magazine has called him one of “eight heroes of the semiconductor revolution”.</p>
			<p>In 2011, he received the “National Medal of Technology and Innovation”, the highest form of recognition given to an engineer by the United States Government. Among the honours bestowed upon him by the NC State University are the 1998 O. Max Gardner Award from the Board of Governors, an award given to the one person within the 16 constituent universities who has made 'the greatest contribution to the welfare of the human race'; as well as the 2011 Alexander Quarles Holladay Medal of Excellence, the highest honour at the University from the Board of Trustees. Dr. Baliga is also a Member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Life Fellow of the IEEE, from whom he has received many awards including the highest recognition, the Medal of Honour in 2014.</p>
			<p>In recognition of his unparalleled contribution to the field of power semiconductor devices and energy efficiency, IIT Madras and its alumni are proud to confer this award upon Dr. B. Jayant Baliga.</p>
